# PROJECT 0x00. Shell, basics

Imagine you have a really smart assistant that can do things on your computer just by typing what you want. That assistant is called a "shell."

Commands: In the shell, you give instructions by typing commands. A command is like a magic word that tells your computer to do something. For example, if you type "ls" and press Enter, it will show you a list of files in the current folder.

Directories and Folders: Your computer has places where it stores things, like a room with shelves. Each of these places is called a "directory" or "folder." When you open the shell, you start in a specific directory. You can move to other directories using the "cd" command. It's like telling your assistant to go to a different room.

Example: cd Documents means "go to the Documents folder."
Files and Text: Everything on your computer is a file, like a book or a toy. You can create files, read them, and change them using the shell. The "cat" command, for instance, lets you see what's inside a file.

Example: cat my_file.txt means "show me what's in the file called 'my_file.txt'."
Copying and Moving: You can copy files from one place to another or move them around. It's like making a copy of a drawing and putting it in a different folder.

Example: cp file.txt backup/ means "copy 'file.txt' to the 'backup' folder."
Removing: If you want to get rid of a file, you can use the "rm" command. It's like telling your assistant to throw something away.

Example: rm old_file.txt means "throw away the file called 'old_file.txt'."
Wildcard (*): The star symbol (*) is like a wildcard that can represent any letters or numbers. For instance, if you want to delete all text files in a folder, you can type rm *.txt.

These are just a few basic things you can do with a shell. It's like having a special language to talk to your computer and tell it what you want it to do.
