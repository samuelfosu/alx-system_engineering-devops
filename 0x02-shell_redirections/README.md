# Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

1. Shell:
Imagine your computer as a house, and the shell is like the front door through which you communicate with the house. The shell is a program that lets you talk to your computer by typing commands. It's like giving instructions to your computer in a language it understands.

2. I/O Redirections:
Now, let's talk about input and output. Think of your computer as having an input (where it gets information) and an output (where it sends information). I/O Redirections are like redirecting the flow of information.

# Input Redirection (<): 
Imagine you have a list of instructions written on a paper. If you want your computer to read those instructions from the paper, you can use < to tell it to take input from that paper.

cat < instructions.txt

This tells the computer to show you the contents of the "instructions.txt" file.

# Output Redirection (>): 
Now, let's say you want to write something down. You can use > to tell the computer to send the output (like the result of a command) to a file.

echo "Hello, computer!" > greeting.txt

This tells the computer to write "Hello, computer!" in a file called "greeting.txt."

3. Filters:
Filters are like helpers that take information, process it, and then give you the result. It's like having a friend who takes your messy room (input), organizes it (process), and hands you back a neat and tidy room (output).

Example of a Filter (grep): Let's say you have a list of books, and you want to find the ones that have the word "adventure" in their titles. You can use a filter called grep to do that.

cat books.txt | grep "adventure"

This tells the computer to show you only the lines in the "books.txt" file that contain the word "adventure."

So, in summary:

Shell is like the language you use to talk to your computer.
I/O Redirections help control where information comes from and goes to.
Filters process information to give you specific results.
