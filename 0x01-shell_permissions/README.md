# Shell, permissions

"shell" and "permissions" are terms related to operating systems, particularly in Unix-based systems like Linux. Let me break down each term for you:

Shell:

A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. It's a text-based interface where users can input commands, and the shell interprets and executes those commands.
Examples of popular shells include Bash (Bourne Again SHell), Zsh (Z Shell), and PowerShell (for Windows).
Permissions:

In the context of file systems, permissions refer to the rules that determine who can access, modify, or execute a file or directory. This is a security feature to control access to data and programs on a computer.

There are three types of permissions:

Read (r): Allows a user to view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory.
Write (w): Permits a user to modify the contents of a file or create, delete, and rename files within a directory.
Execute (x): Gives a user the ability to run a file or traverse through a directory.
Permissions are assigned to three categories of users:

Owner: The person who created the file or directory.
Group: A collection of users, typically with related permissions.
Others: Anyone else who is not the owner or in the group.

Permission settings are usually represented as a series of letters (r, w, x) and are organized into groups of three, like "rwxr-xr--". Each group corresponds to the permissions for the owner, group, and others.
